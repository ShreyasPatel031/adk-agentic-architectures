# Critique for 14_dry_run Agent (V3 - Final)

## Implementation Analysis

The updated `14_dry_run` agent uses a custom `DryRunAgent(BaseAgent)` to orchestrate a Propose -> Dry Run -> Approve -> Execute workflow. However, the implementation of the "Approve" step is critically flawed.

The architecture is as follows:
- A custom `DryRunAgent` runs a `Proposer` and a `DryRunExecutor`.
- It then simulates the approval step with a simple, hardcoded check in Python: it automatically rejects the plan if the words "error" or "issue" are in the dry run output.
- This is an **automated review**, not a **human approval**.

## Architectural Assessment

- **Incorrect Pattern (No Human-in-the-Loop):** The core value and defining feature of a Dry-Run Harness architecture is the **human-in-the-loop** safety check. It is designed to pause execution and require explicit consent from a human user before proceeding. This implementation completely removes the human from the loop, replacing them with a trivial keyword check. This defeats the entire purpose of the architecture.
- **Comparison to Original:** This is not a faithful migration. The original notebook (`14_dry_run.ipynb`) correctly implements the human approval step by waiting for direct user input.
- **Best Practices:** The correct way to implement this in ADK would be to use the `get_user_choice` tool. An `Approver` agent should present the dry run results and use `get_user_choice` to get a "yes" or "no" from the user. The custom agent's logic should then conditionally run the `FinalExecutor` based on that human input.

## Conclusion

The migration for the `14_dry_run` agent is **FAILED**. It is architecturally incorrect because it removes the essential human-in-the-loop approval step, which is the entire point of a dry-run safety harness.
