# Critique for 07_blackboard Agent (V3 - Final)

## Implementation Analysis

The `07_blackboard` agent correctly implements the blackboard architecture using a custom `BlackboardAgent` that inherits from ADK's `BaseAgent`.

The architecture is as follows:
- The `blackboard_agent.py` file defines a `BlackboardAgent(BaseAgent)` class.
- The agent's `_run_async_impl` method contains the core logic:
    1. It initializes a `blackboard` dictionary in the session state.
    2. It enters a loop, first calling the `Controller` agent.
    3. The `Controller`'s output is used to dynamically select the next specialist agent to run.
    4. After the specialist runs, its output is written back to the shared `blackboard` in the state.
    5. The loop continues until the `Controller` outputs "FINISH".
- The `blackboard_agent.yaml` is marked with `architecture: custom` and defines the `Controller` and the pool of available specialists.

## Architectural Assessment

- **Correct Pattern:** The use of a custom `BaseAgent` to manage the central state (`blackboard`) and implement the dynamic, controller-driven loop is the correct and most robust way to build a blackboard system in ADK.
- **Comparison to Original:** This is a high-fidelity and faithful migration of the architecture from the `07_blackboard.ipynb` notebook. It successfully recreates the core concepts of a shared data store, multiple specialists, and a dynamic control unit.
- **Best Practices:** The agent is an excellent example of using a custom `BaseAgent` to implement a complex, stateful, and dynamic multi-agent workflow that goes beyond the capabilities of standard workflow agents.

## Conclusion

The migration for the `07_blackboard` agent is **SUCCESSFUL**. Although testing was not possible, a static review of the code confirms that it is a functional, robust, and architecturally sound agent that correctly models the blackboard pattern.
