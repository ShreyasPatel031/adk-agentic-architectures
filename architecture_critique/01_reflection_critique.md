# Critique for 01_reflection Agent (V3 - Final)

## Implementation Analysis

The `01_reflection` agent correctly implements the reflection architecture using an ADK `SequentialAgent`. The implementation consists of two distinct sub-agents as defined in the `reflection_agent.yaml`:
1.  **Generator:** Creates an initial draft of the content.
2.  **Reflector:** Critiques the draft and then rewrites it, incorporating its own feedback.

## Architectural Assessment

- **Correct Pattern:** The use of a `SequentialAgent` to model the "Generate -> Reflect" workflow is an appropriate and effective implementation of the reflection pattern.
- **Comparison to Original:** This implementation is a faithful representation of the core logic presented in the `01_reflection.ipynb` notebook.
- **Best Practices:** The agent is well-structured, configuration-driven, and uses the appropriate ADK component for the task.

## Conclusion

The migration for the `01_reflection` agent is **SUCCESSFUL**. It is a functional and architecturally correct agent that properly models the reflection pattern.
