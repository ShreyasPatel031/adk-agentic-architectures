# Critique for 04_planning Agent (V3 - Final)

## Implementation Analysis

The `04_planning` agent correctly implements a Plan-and-Execute architecture using an ADK `SequentialAgent`. The implementation consists of three distinct sub-agents defined in `planning_agent.yaml`:
1.  **Planner:** Creates a step-by-step plan and saves it to the state with `output_key: "plan"`.
2.  **Executor:** Receives the `{plan}` from the state, executes it using its tools, and saves the results with `output_key: "results"`.
3.  **Synthesizer:** Receives the `{results}` from the state and formulates the final answer.

## Architectural Assessment

- **Correct Pattern:** The use of a `SequentialAgent` with distinct agents for planning, execution, and synthesis is a classic and correct implementation of this architecture.
- **Comparison to Original:** This implementation is a faithful and direct migration of the Plan-Execute-Synthesize workflow demonstrated in the `04_planning.ipynb` notebook.
- **Best Practices:** The agent is well-structured, configuration-driven, and makes effective use of `SequentialAgent` and `output_key` to build the multi-step workflow.

## Conclusion

The migration for the `04_planning` agent is **SUCCESSFUL**. It is a functional and architecturally correct agent that properly models the Plan-and-Execute pattern.
