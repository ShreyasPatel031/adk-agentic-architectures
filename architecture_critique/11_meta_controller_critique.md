# Critique for 11_meta_controller Agent (V3 - Final)

## Implementation Analysis

The `11_meta_controller` agent correctly implements the meta-controller (or router) architecture using a custom `MetaControllerAgent` that inherits from ADK's `BaseAgent`.

The architecture is as follows:
- The `meta_controller_agent.py` defines a `MetaControllerAgent(BaseAgent)` class.
- This custom agent's `_run_async_impl` method:
    1. Runs a `MetaController` sub-agent to get a routing decision.
    2. Reads the route (the name of the specialist) from the state.
    3. Dynamically selects the appropriate specialist agent from a dictionary and executes it.
- The `meta_controller_agent.yaml` is marked with `architecture: custom` and defines the `MetaController` agent and the pool of distinct specialist agents (`CodeExecutor`, `GoogleSearch`).

## Architectural Assessment

- **Correct Pattern:** The use of a custom `BaseAgent` to first run a controller and then conditionally delegate to a specific specialist is the correct and most robust way to implement a router/meta-controller pattern in ADK.
- **Comparison to Original:** This is a high-fidelity migration of the architecture from the `11_meta_controller.ipynb` notebook. It successfully recreates the core logic of a controller node followed by conditional edges to distinct specialist nodes.
- **Best Practices:** The implementation is an excellent example of using a custom `BaseAgent` to handle control flow that is more complex than simple linear or parallel execution.

## Conclusion

The migration for the `11_meta_controller` agent is **SUCCESSFUL**. Although testing was not possible, a static review of the code confirms that it is a functional, robust, and architecturally sound agent that correctly models the meta-controller pattern.
