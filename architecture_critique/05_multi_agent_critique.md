# Critique for 05_multi_agent Agent (V3 - Final)

## Implementation Analysis

The `05_multi_agent` agent correctly implements a multi-agent system using ADK's `SequentialAgent`. The implementation consists of three distinct sub-agents as defined in `multi_agent.yaml`:
1.  **TechnicalAnalyst:** Performs a technical analysis and saves its output to the `technical_analysis` state key.
2.  **ResearchAnalyst:** Performs a research analysis and saves its output to the `research_analysis` state key.
3.  **Manager:** Receives the `{technical_analysis}` and `{research_analysis}` from the state and synthesizes them into a final report.

## Architectural Assessment

- **Correct Pattern:** The use of `SequentialAgent` to orchestrate a team of specialized agents followed by a synthesizer is an excellent application of ADK's capabilities and a classic multi-agent pattern.
- **Comparison to Original:** This implementation is a faithful migration of the core idea from the `05_multi_agent.ipynb` notebook.
- **Best Practices:** The code is well-structured, configuration-driven, and makes effective use of `SequentialAgent` and `output_key` for passing state between agents.

## Conclusion

The migration for the `05_multi_agent` agent is **SUCCESSFUL**. It accurately translates the concept of a multi-agent specialist team into a functional and well-structured ADK application.
